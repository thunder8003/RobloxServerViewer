# Roblox Server Viewer

### This application makes it easy to find small servers for any roblox game you'd like.

## Installation

The only thing you need to do to run it is to install the server files in the server branch and run it with nodejs, then you can access the main website from https://thunder8003.github.io/RobloxServerViewer/. The reason you have to run the server itself is due to roblox api limits.
